# BitCache

BitCache brings a **native** **Web3** user experience to BSV.

A UX where you can avoid vendor lock-in and walled gardens because your data is onchain and you can move seamlessly from wallet/app interface to interface.&#x20;

This is similar to the UX with email. You can easily move across email clients such as Apple mail, Gmail, Microsoft Outlook, Thunderbird, while still using the same email address and the same email history.
