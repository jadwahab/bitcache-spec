### What if other wallets don't use BitCache?

BitCache put the power back in the hands of the users. If a wallet does not want to cooperate with this new wallet infrastructure, then users can just as easily pull their seed from that wallet, scan the blockchain for their transactions (disaster recovery style) to populate their BitCache, and simply use another wallet interface.
