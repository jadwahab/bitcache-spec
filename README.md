# Welcome!

## What is BitCache?

BitCache is basically just a cache of your onchain data that you own and can control but also share with and across any wallet or Bitcoin app.

## How does it work?

{% content-ref url="bitcache/" %}
[bitcache](bitcache/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Want to jump right in?

Jump in to the quick start docs and start integrating your wallet or app with BitCache:

{% content-ref url="quick-start.md" %}
[quick-start.md](quick-start.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Want to deep dive?

Dive a little deeper and start exploring our API reference to get an idea of everything that's possible with the API:

{% content-ref url="reference/api-reference/" %}
[api-reference](reference/api-reference/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
